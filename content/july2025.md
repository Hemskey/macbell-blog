Hello everyone, we're already in 2025! 
This website has made changes, we moved off square space and moved onto our own little site, meaning I write this in RStudio in markdown files and then post them up on our github files and then magic happens and our website is updated. It's neat and fun but also a new process for me. 

I sit here at work, as I wait to transition to a new team, with my yerba mate in hand (enlighten mint flavour) and my headphones on the desk next to me. I am planning on doing things, I just don't know what to do yet. I have so many ideas and never enough time it seems like. What's happened since 2023 you ask? Oh well we moved...again and renovated a ton...again. And then we moved again and had a baby, oh and I'm changing teams at work and I am also focusing on other ways to spend my time creatively. Which leads me to here, and here I am today. I love this little space, its a place I can call my own and write about whatever I want to but I'm not sure in what direction I should head next. Cheers to just beginning, as some would say thats the hardest part. Let's see if I can post again in 2025 and not wait years to do it! 

Thank you for being here, 
Kim
