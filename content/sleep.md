**6 hours will be fine.** That’s what I used to think when I would stay up a couple hours too late. Stayed up to play my favorite game a little longer, stayed out with a friend longer than expected, or watched a movie instead of sleeping. I mean, 6 out of the 7 or 8 that is widely accepted as necessary is pretty good, right? Nope. Not by a good margin.

I recently read the book “Why We Sleep” by David Walker, Ph.D. This book created a level of anxiety that I generally don’t feel. In this book, topics that are primarily covered are the side effects of not getting enough sleep. These side effects include increased anxiety, irritability, heart disease, brain disease, and the likes. Everything from short-term problems, to long-term demise. Damn.

**So why isn’t 6 hours good enough?** Well, it turns out most of the wonderful benefits and healing properties of sleeping occur in the last few hours of sleep. This happens to be those last couple hours that I would frequently shave off on a regular basis, where lies the problem. I was losing out on many benefits such as increased memory retention, reducing my irritability, increasing my performance in the gym, and the basic feature of dreaming! Before this book, I had always proclaimed that I didn’t dream since I was much younger. Sure I would dream once in a blue moon, but nothing I would remember aside from feeling ‘different’. In hindsight, it makes complete sense why those dreams just stopped. Since my high school days, I have routinely slept 5-6 hours per night. I worked full-time in high school, then I went to the Navy where sleep is a luxury not wielded by many, and off to college where we all know that we abuse(d) sleep, myself being no different.

**What have I done since?** I’ve started to sleep in a more routine, predictable way. I have an alarm for 10pm, and one for 6am, one to get ready for bed and the other to wake up. Generally, I do this every day of the week, including weekends. The weekends are a bit harder due to old habits, but through some consistent effort I feel like it is becoming easier and easier each week. I’ve also significantly reduced my caffeine intake, which I’m unsure if it has had much effect. I’m now approximately 1 month in and the difference is night and day (pun intended). There are a lot of good tips and recommendations that I have incorporated into my daily life, but like any new habit, simply starting is the biggest and most simple step to take. I highly suggest and recommend at least checking out the Ted Talk by Dr. Walker. If the talk hits an interest, do take a look at the book.
