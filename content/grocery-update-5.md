Week 5 already. We are half way to our next vacation in 5 weeks, and that vacation is the end of this grocery savings and extreme budgeting thing we’ve committed ourselves to. I’m looking forward to it being done.

BUT that being said, we spent a little more than we usually would this week for a few reasons. This week was hard, harder than others because some personal things happened to us and shifted our worlds forever, therefore we went and had lunch. Not too extreme of a reward for what happened but none the less, we had a lunch outside the apartment and spent ~$90 on it. It was wonderful, was it worth it? Hells yes it was. Here is the break down for this weeks Grocery Update week 5 extreme budgeting goal…

And I’ll save all the details, I think the past week updates pretty much sum up the things we eat to balance out our macros. Sure there are additional little things like salsa for taste, or vegetables for volume. But here we go, sans the detail!

Groceries: $77.04

Additional: $65.56

Lunch: $94.85

This week went spent a total of: $237.45

Meaning within the last 5 weeks we have spent a total of: $810.79

Breaking this down a little further I want to add in some background. This is the most we’ve spent in the past 5 weeks, but before we even began this journey we decided to budget ourselves roughly a few hundred dollars a month to spend on things. Just to make sure we don’t miss our on quality of life things, for instance if we go to the hospital and have to pay a bill or something random comes up….this allowance would help with that. I also want to mention that within the time of this challenge we have moved with movers, and I have applied for some of my own green card - alien type - residential - citizenship stuff which we all know costs too. Those things are not accounted for here, the intent is to monitor what we’ve saved so I add in as much detail as I can but everyone knows the internet can be a weird place. I don’t like adding too much detail…because that’s weird and feels weird, its just all around weird to me. Therefore I don’t do it. That being said, I do enjoy sharing our savings and sharing when we meet goals and I’ll continue to do that BUT I also want to mention a few things. Like the fact that our household is a double income household, that we don’t have kids, we live in the US of A and we have no debt (except I guess now a mortgage), we have no vehicle and our other bills like phone, utilities and everything etc etc is also not included here. Why do I leave these things out? because it’s all about the savings, I could go into how we pay $100 a month for two phones on our plans but that is not something we’re going to change in order to save soooo I leave it out. Just like I add in grocery items because we can shift our eating to save more moneys. Hope that makes sense.

This savings thing has taught me a lot, I’ve felt restricted and limited by money on many occasions. I do not go out for social outings with friends…I literally have coffee if I have anything at all when I do see people. And by coffee I mean a drip coffee….usually a tall or short if they have it. But I like that I’ve been able to do this because as restricted as it is, it’s showing me just how much I do spend on things and I can look around now and see how many ‘things’ there are to spend on. Makeup, skincare, clothes, services, etc. There’s just so much we can spend our money on and I’m thankful I have the opportunity to take these weeks to not spend on them as much, and see what it does to my overall spending habits. Now….enough of my ranting and onto week 6.
