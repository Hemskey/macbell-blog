We are already more than half way through our challenge now….dang! And I have some more updates on our grocery list this week. We’ve been really feeling the pain of money/food restrictions lately! Isn’t it weird how you want to buy everything when you don’t have the option to? And then when you do you don’t want to spend anything? That’s me at the moment, feeling like I could buy 10 million things just because I can’t haha!

Our grocery list looks the same…cheese, beef, tofu, fancy sparkling waters, gatorades (sugar free)…etc.

Groceries: $51.85

Other: $9.30

Lunch date at Poke Works: $26.30

Cleaning supplies: $12.07

Soap, shampoo: $20.52

Extra sweets like kitkats…chocolate etc: $25.87

Groceries: $71.47

**Total: $217.38**

Last week we were at a total of $810.79 plus this week’s spending that brings us to a grand total of $1028.17! We have spent just over $1000 on odds and ends things, groceries, random lunch dates, and others. That has been a huge task of us, we are doing a great job. Only 5 weeks left until we hit the goal deadline! We will keep this blog updated as we reach our goals.
